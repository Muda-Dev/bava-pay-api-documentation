# Implementation Guide

Technical requirements and best practices for implementing provider endpoints.

## Boilerplate

Access our provider boilerplate at: [Liquidity Rail Provider Boilerplate](https://github.com/Muda-Dev/lr-provider-boilerplate)

The boilerplate provides a complete Node.js TypeScript implementation with:
- All required provider endpoints
- Webhook integration
- Authentication and validation
- Error handling and logging
- Rate limiting and security

## Response Format

All responses must follow this standard format:

```json
{
    "status": 200,
    "message": "success",
    "data": { /* response data */ }
}
```

## Error Handling

Implement proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes:

- `200`: Success
- `400`: Bad Request
- `401`: Unauthorized
- `404`: Not Found
- `500`: Internal Server Error

## Security Requirements

- **HTTPS**: All endpoints must be served over HTTPS
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming requests
- **Authentication**: Use secure authentication methods (MUDA will provide credentials)

## Getting Started

1. **Contact MUDA**: Reach out to become a registered provider
2. **Use the Boilerplate**: Clone and customize the provided boilerplate
3. **Implement Endpoints**: Build the required endpoints in your system
4. **Testing**: Test your endpoints with MUDA's sandbox environment
5. **Production**: Deploy your endpoints and go live
