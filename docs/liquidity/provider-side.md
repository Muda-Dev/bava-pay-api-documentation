# Provider Side Endpoints

The Provider Side endpoints are **standards that external service providers must implement in their own systems** to integrate with the Liquidity Rail platform.

## Overview

Providers are not integrating with MUDA's API directly - instead, they must build these endpoints in their own infrastructure. This documentation covers:

- [Core Endpoints](./provider-core-endpoints.md) - Essential endpoints every provider must implement
- [Transaction Management](./provider-transactions.md) - Transaction tracking and status updates
- [Webhook Integration](./provider-webhooks.md) - Sending status updates to MUDA
- [Implementation Guide](./provider-implementation.md) - Technical requirements and best practices

## Quick Start

1. **Contact MUDA**: Reach out to become a registered provider
2. **Implement Core Endpoints**: Build the required endpoints in your system
3. **Add Webhooks**: Implement webhook notifications for status updates
4. **Test & Deploy**: Test with sandbox environment, then go live

## Support

For questions about becoming a provider or implementing these endpoints, please contact the MUDA development team.
