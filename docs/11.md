# Webhooks APIs

The API sends webhook notifications for transaction status updates. To receive these notifications, you need to register a webhook URL with your account.

### Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "type": "transaction_status",
  "timestamp": "2023-06-01T12:00:00Z",
  "reference_id": "ref123456",
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "amount": "10000",
  "currency": "UGX",
  "sender_account": "GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "receiver_account": "256XXXXXXXXX",
  "transaction_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "meta": "Payment processed successfully",
  "client_id": "12345"
}
```


## Client Errors

- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required or has failed.
- **403 Forbidden**: The client does not have access rights to the content.
- **404 Not Found**: The server could not find the requested resource.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: The client has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (rate limiting).

Example error response:

```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "message": "Resource not found",
  "data": null
}
```

## Server Errors

- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is not ready to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: The server did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.

Example server error response:

```json
{
  "status": 500,
  "message": "An unexpected error occurred",
  "data": null
}
```

### Webhook Status Values

- `PENDING`: The transaction is being processed
- `SUCCESS`: The transaction completed successfully
- `FAILED`: The transaction failed

## Supported Payment Methods

The API supports multiple payment methods based on the `service_name` specified in the product configuration:

1. **MOBILE_MONEY**: Mobile money transactions (e.g., MTN Mobile Money, Airtel Money)
2. **BANK_TRANSFER**: Bank transfer transactions
3. **CARD_PAYMENT**: Card payment transactions (for collections)
4. **CRYPTO**: Cryptocurrency transactions (for payouts)

## Offline Mode

For payout transactions (PUSH), the system supports offline mode. If the connection to the payment provider is unavailable, the transaction will be stored and processed later when the connection is restored. The webhook will be sent once the transaction is processed.
