# Error Handling

All API endpoints return standard HTTP status codes. In case of an error, the response will include an error message and, if applicable, additional error details.

Example error response:

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "message": "Invalid data",
  "data": [
    {
      "code": "invalid_type",
      "expected": "number",
      "received": "string",
      "path": ["amount"],
      "message": "Expected number, received string"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting. The current limits are:
- 100 requests per minute per client
- 5,000 requests per day per client

If you exceed these limits, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
