# Authentication

All API requests (except for login) require authentication using a JWT token. The token should be included in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

### Generating the `your_jwt_token`

To generate the JWT token, make a `POST` request to the authentication endpoint with your `secret_key` and `api_key`.

**Request:**

```
POST /auth/token
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
    "secret_key": "test_sec-***********************",
    "api_key": "test_key-***********************"
}
```

**Response:**

- **Status Code:** `200 OK`

```json
{
    "status": 200,
    "message": "success",
    "data": {
        "access_token": "Your Token",
        "token_type": "Bearer",
        "expires_in": 7200
    }
}
```

Use the `access_token` from the response as your `your_jwt_token` in subsequent API requests.

### Status Codes

Here are the possible status codes for the authentication endpoint:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the access token was generated.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid or missing required parameters.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The provided `secret_key` or `api_key` is incorrect.
- **403 Forbidden**: The client does not have permission to access the resource.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an error while processing the request.
